## Enabling

If you would like to use sessions in your app, you must first set `ENABLE_SESSIONS=true` in your `config.sh`.

## Using

Sessions in bash stack are similar to PHP. You can read data from the `SESSION` variable, and write any changes you make to it by calling the `save_session` function. See the [sessions example](https://github.com/cgsdev0/bash-stack/tree/main/examples/sessions/pages) for a more detailed explanation.
